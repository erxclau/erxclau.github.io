            <header>Here's some stuff I've done:</header>
            <div>
                <b>Solon</b> - <a href="https://github.com/SolonEDU">GitHub Organization</a><br>
                Solon is a team of individuals that I've worked with for a while. We've made two apps related to
                school.<br>
                For lack of creativity, we named them both "Solon".
                <ul>
                    <li><span>solon-mobile</span> - a mobile app written in Flutter to increase parent engagement at our
                        high school</li>
                    <li><span>solon-blockchain</span> - a blockchain website using Solidity to engage a school community
                        to vote on issues and budgets</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>/r/RareHouseplantsBST subreddit bot</b> - <a href="https://github.com/ericlau00/rare-houseplants-bst-bot">Repository</a><br>
                I made a bot using Python to monitor a subreddit my sister runs where people buy,
                sell, or trade rare houseplants.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>messenger-data-viz</b> - <a href="https://github.com/ericlau00/messenger-data-viz">Repository</a><br>
                Starting out as something for a friend, I made an application to analyze and visualize Facebook
                Messenger
                conversations using Python and D3.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Software Development</b> - <a href="https://github.com/ericlau00/software-development">Repository</a><br>
                I took a class in Flask web development during my senior year. Here are some of the websites I had the
                pleasure of working on.
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Caerus</span> - a website designed to modernize an opportunity bulletin provided by a
                        staff member at my high school</li>
                    <li><span>RYthEM</span> - a website using the Spotify API with various music related games and
                        features</li>
                    <li><span>covid3.js</span> - a website to show the non-medical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
                        using D3
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Systems Level Programming</b> - <a href="https://github.com/ericlau00/systems-level-programming">Repository</a><br>
                I also took a class learning lower-level programming using the Linux environment. I also made some cool
                projects for
                this class.
                <ul>
                    <li><span>conSH</span> - a bash terminal built from scratch using C</li>
                    <li><span>Guess Whomst've</span> - a terminal adaptation of the classic Hasbro Guess Who game
                        written
                        in C</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Computer Graphics</b> - <a href="https://github.com/ericlau00/computer-graphics">Repository</a><br>
                I took a class in computer graphics. I wrote a graphics engine
                (mostly) in C. <br>
                And then I made some pretty pictures, some of which can be seen <a
