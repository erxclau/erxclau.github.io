            <p>
                Hey y'all! My name is Eric Lau. I'm from Bushwick, Brooklyn and I'm a freshman studying computer science
                at the University of Michigan. I work at The Michigan Daily where I make data visualizations. I'm also a
                part of the Michigan Mars Rover team where I (unsurprisingly) program rovers. Outside of those, I'm also
                exploring topics in computer science like web development and blockchain through extracurriculars or
                personal projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides computer science, I have interests in politics, philosophy, and social psychology. I believe
                programming is ultimately a tool which should be combined with other disciplines and studies. In my free
                time, I love listening to podcasts and music, and curating Spotify playlists. I also enjoy going on long
                runs, writing, and thrifting!

                            Solon as an idea has the objective of increasing parent engagement at schools by allowing
                            them to vote on school policies and discuss ideas with faculty. It achieves this goal with a
                            mobile app for parents and an administrative site for staff. The two platforms communicated
                            with each other using an API and database that we built. I worked on a team of several other
                            students as well as with people from Google and the Bushwick Generator. I worked primarily
                            on the mobile app, connecting API routes and implementing user interface designs.

                            messenger-data-viz is a tool I built which analyzes Facebook Messenger conversations in
                            terms of raw statistics and natural language. It started out as a single use case to look at
                            the conversation between a friend and I but I then expanded it to be used generally. The
                            analysis is visualuzed in a locally hosted website.

                            I attended Stuyvesant High School where one of the school faculty provided a weekly bulletin
                            for opportunities and scholarships in PDF form. Some friends and I thought the bulletin was
                            hard to navigate so we created a website named Caerus to modernize the process of finding
                            and creating items in the bulletin. I worked on implementing the routes, authentication, and
                            an email notification system.

                            covid3.js is a website that analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in non-medical
                            areas like the news, social media, and transportation. My friends and I were heavily
                            inspired by The New York Times and FiveThirtyEight. I worked on analysis of the NYC
                            transportation system as well as a general template for line graphs.
