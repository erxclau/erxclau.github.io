        <p>
            Hey y'all! My name is Eric Lau. I'm from Bushwick, Brooklyn and I'm a freshman studying computer science at
            the University of Michigan. I work at The Michigan Daily where I make data visualizations. I'm also a part
            of the Michigan Mars Rover team where I (unsurprisingly) program rovers. Outside of those, I'm also
            exploring general topics in computer science like web development and blockchain through extracurriculars or
            personal projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides computer science, I have interests in politics, philosophy, and social psychology. I believe
            programming is ultimately a tool which should be combined with other disciplines and studies. In my free
            time, I love listening to podcasts and music, and curating Spotify playlists. I also enjoy going on long
            runs, writing, and thrifting!

            <p>
                Solon as an idea has the objective of increasing parental engagement at schools by allowing parents to
                vote on school policies and discuss ideas with faculty. It originally began as a blockchain website
                using Solidity, MongoDB, and Node.js. It then turned into two platforms: a mobile app built using
                Flutter, and a administrative website for staff built using Node.js and Express.js. The two platforms
                communicated with each other using an API and SQL backend that we built. I worked primarily on the
                mobile app, connecting API routes and implementing user interface designs.<br>

            <p>
                messenger-data-viz is a tool I built which analyzes Facebook Messenger conversations in terms of raw
                statistics and natural language. It started out as a single use case to look at the conversation between
                a friend and I but I then expanded it to be used generally. The analysis is visualuzed in a local web
                application using Flask and D3.<br>

            <p>
                Resourceful is a website meant to help people learn about topics they're interested in by providing
                various resources that are curated by the website's users. It was built using Node.js, Express.js, and
                MongoDB. I worked primarily on the website layout and CSS styling. This website won Best UI/UX (Aurora
                Hack) at SBUHacks 2020.<br>

            <p>
                I attended Stuyvesant High School where one of the school faculty provided a weekly bulletin for
                opportunities and scholarships in PDF form. Some friends and I thought the bulletin was hard to navigate
                so we created a website named Caerus to modernize the process of finding and creating items in the
                bulletin. We used Flask, Google OAuth2, and SQL. I worked on implementing the Flask website routes,
                OAuth authentication, and an email notification system using cron jobs.<br>

            <p>
                covid3.js is a website that analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in non-medical areas like the
                news, social media, and transportation. It was built using Flask and D3, along with several data sets.
                We were heavily inspired by The New York Times and FiveThirtyEight. I worked on analysis of the NYC
                transportation system as well as a general template for line graphs.<br>

            <p>
                I took a course at Stuyvesant where I wrote a graphics engine essentially from scratch. I implemented
                most of the features in C but some of the more advanced features used Python. It's capable of realistic
                lighting, animations, and can take in MDL instructions.<br>
