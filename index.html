            <p>
                Hey y'all! My name is Eric Lau. I'm from Bushwick, Brooklyn and I'm a freshman studying computer science
                at the University of Michigan. I work at The Michigan Daily where I make data visualizations. I'm also a
                part of the Michigan Mars Rover team where I (unsurprisingly) program rovers. Outside of those, I'm also
                exploring topics in computer science like web development and blockchain through extracurriculars or
                personal projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides computer science, I have interests in politics, philosophy, and social psychology. I believe
                programming is ultimately a tool which should be combined with other disciplines and studies. In my free
                time, I love listening to podcasts and music, and curating Spotify playlists. I also enjoy going on long
                runs, writing, and thrifting!

                        Solon as an idea has the objective of increasing parental engagement at schools by allowing
                        parents to vote on school policies and discuss ideas with faculty. It originally began as a
                        blockchain website using Solidity, MongoDB, and Node.js. It then turned into two platforms: a
                        mobile app built using Flutter, and an administrative site for staff built using Node.js and
                        Express.js. The two platforms communicated with each other using an API and SQL backend that we
                        built. I worked on a team of several other students as well as with people from Google and the
                        Bushwick Generator. I worked primarily on the mobile app, connecting API routes and implementing
                        user interface designs.

                        messenger-data-viz is a tool I built which analyzes Facebook Messenger conversations in terms of
                        raw statistics and natural language. It started out as a single use case to look at the
                        conversation between a friend and I but I then expanded it to be used generally. The analysis is
                        visualuzed in a locally hosted website using Flask and D3.

                        Resourceful is a website meant to help people learn about topics they're interested in by
                        providing various resources that are curated by the sites's users. It was built using Node.js,
                        Express.js, and MongoDB. I built it with two friends at SBUHacks 2020. I worked on the layout
                        and styling of the website, and we won Best UI/UX (Aurora Hack).

                        I attended Stuyvesant High School where one of the school faculty provided a weekly bulletin for
                        opportunities and scholarships in PDF form. Some friends and I thought the bulletin was hard to
                        navigate so we created a website named Caerus to modernize the process of finding and creating
                        items in the bulletin. We used Flask, Google OAuth2, and SQL. I worked on implementing the Flask
                        routes, OAuth authentication, and an email notification system using cron jobs.

                        covid3.js is a website that analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in non-medical areas
                        like the news, social media, and transportation. It was built using Flask and D3, along with
                        several data sets. My friends and I were heavily inspired by The New York Times and
                        FiveThirtyEight. I worked on analysis of the NYC transportation system as well as a general
                        template for line graphs.

                        I took a course at Stuyvesant where I wrote a graphics engine essentially from scratch. I
                        implemented most of the features in C but some of the more advanced features used Python. It's
                        capable of realistic lighting, animations, and can take in MDL instructions.<br>
