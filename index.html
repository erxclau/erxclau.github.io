                <a href="https://github.com/SolonEDU"><b>Solon</b></a><br>
                Solon is a team of individuals that I've worked with for a while. We've made two apps related to
                school.<br> For lack of creativity, we named them both "Solon".
                <ul>
                    <li><span><a href="https://github.com/SolonEDU/solon-mobile">solon-mobile</a></span> - a mobile app
                        written in Flutter to increase parent engagement at our high school</li>

                        bot</b></a><br>
                I made a bot using Python to monitor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RareHouseplantsBST/">a
                    subreddit</a> my sister runs where people buy, sell, or trade rare houseplants.

                Starting out as something for a friend, I made an application to analyze and visualize Facebook
                Messenger conversations using Python and D3.

                I took a class in Flask web development during my senior year. Here are some of the websites I had the
                pleasure of working on.
                <ul>
                    <li><span><a href="https://github.com/vsofat/caerus">Caerus</a></span> - a website designed to
                        modernize an opportunity bulletin provided by a staff member at my high school</li>

                        - a website using the Spotify API with various music related
                        games and features</li>
                    <li><span><a href="https://github.com/kazijamal/covid3.js">covid3.js</a></span> - a website to show
                        the non-medical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic using D3
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        Programming</b></a><br> I also took a class learning lower-level programming using the Linux
                environment. I also made some cool projects for this class.
                <ul>
                    <li><span><a

                <a href="https://github.com/ericlau00/computer-graphics"><b>Computer Graphics</b></a><br>
                I took a class in computer graphics. I wrote a graphics engine (mostly) in C. It has some pretty cool
                lighting, can handle animation, and takes in MDL instructions. I made some pretty pictures, some of
                which can be seen <a href="http://gallery.stuycs.org">here</a>.
